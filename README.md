ESP32 Smart Thermostat V1.5

A Wi-Fi-connected smart thermostat built on the ESP32 platform. It provides real-time temperature and humidity monitoring, PID-controlled heating, and a full-featured web interface for configuration and alerts.

📷 Overview

Designed for reliability, this thermostat is ideal for greenhouses, reptile enclosures, incubators, and more. It offers OLED display output, live sensor updates, persistent settings, and optional email reporting via Gmail.

🔧 Hardware Requirements

ESP32 Heltec WiFi Kit V3 (or compatible)

BME280 Sensor (I2C)

SSD1306 OLED Display (128x64, I2C)

Solid State Relay (SSR) for heating control

Internet connection for NTP sync and email features

💾 Required Libraries

Install these libraries in Arduino IDE:

WiFi (built-in)

ESPmDNS (built-in)

Preferences (built-in)

Wire (built-in)

Adafruit BME280 and Adafruit Unified Sensor

ESPAsyncWebServer → GitHub

AsyncTCP → GitHub

ESP Mail Client → GitHub

HT_SSD1306Wire.h → (from Heltec ESP32 library)

🚀 Installation Instructions

Install Arduino IDE (1.8.19+)

Install ESP32 Board Support:

Arduino > Preferences > Additional URLs:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

Boards Manager → Install "esp32"

Install the required libraries (see above)

Wire the components:

BME280 → SDA (GPIO47), SCL (GPIO48)

OLED → I2C (shared with BME280)

SSR → GPIO1

Upload the code to your ESP32 via Arduino IDE

Access the device via http://esp32.local or the shown IP

🌐 Web Interface

Access the thermostat interface:

View live temperature, humidity, and heater status

Set Wi-Fi credentials, PID parameters, alarm thresholds

Enable/disable email alerts and schedule daily reports

Send test email and reset settings to defaults

📨 Email Reporting Setup

Use a Gmail account with App Passwords enabled

Input:

Sender Email

Gmail App Password

Recipient Email

🕒 Time Zone Setup

The firmware sets the UK time zone with automatic DST:

setenv("TZ", "GMT0BST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0", 1);
tzset();

This provides correct local time (GMT or BST) for logs and email reports.
